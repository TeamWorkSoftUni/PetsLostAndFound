The web application is supposed to include two parts:

  -	Categorized catalog of Reports with ability to view detailed information
  - Administration interface for editing and deletion of Reports

Provide the following functionality to all visitors (without authentication):

  -	Browse categories of Reports
  -	Advanced search (by category, price, location, etc.)
  -	View details about an event (information, location, date, price and availability of tickets)
  
In addition to the previous functionality, registered users can:

  -	Publish their own Report
  -	View contact information of other users
  -	Leave comments on Reports
  
Authenticated administrators should be able to:

  -	Moderate Reports and comments
  -	Manage user profiles (ban users who post inappropriate messages)
